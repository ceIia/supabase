Now that you're acquainted with Realtime's Broadcast, Presence, and Postgres CDC features, you can familiarize yourself with Realtime's API by reproducing the core features of Realtime's Multiplayer demo found at [multiplayer.dev](https://multiplayer.dev).

## Prerequisites

- Install the `supabase-js` client:

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

- Get the public `anon` access token from your project's [API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api).

## Broadcast

Broadcast allows a client to send messages and multiple clients to receive the messages.

The broadcasted messages are ephemeral. They are not persisted to the database and are directly relayed through the Realtime servers. This is ideal for sending information like cursor positions where minimal latency is important, but persisting them is not.

### Cursor Positions

For this example, cursor positions will be randomly generated.

You can start sending a client's cursor positions to other clients in channel `room1`:

```js
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js')

const supabase = createClient(
  'https://your-project-ref.supabase.co',
  'anon-key',
  {
    realtime: {
      params: {
        eventsPerSecond: 10,
      },
    },
  }
)

// Channel name can be any string.
// Create channels with the same name for both the broadcasting and receiving clients.
const channel = supabase.channel('room1')

// Subscribe registers your client with the server
channel.subscribe((status) => {
  if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    // now you can start broadcasting cursor positions
    setInterval(() => {
      channel.send({
        type: 'broadcast',
        event: 'cursor-pos',
        payload: { x: Math.random(), y: Math.random() },
      })
      console.log(status)
    }, 100)
  }
})
```

:::info
JavaScript client has a default rate limit of 1 Realtime event every 100 milliseconds that's configured by `eventsPerSecond`.
:::

Another client can subscribe to channel `room1` and receive cursor positions:

```js
// Supabase client setup

// Listen to broadcast messages.
supabase
  .channel('room1')
  .on('broadcast', { event: 'cursor-pos' }, (payload) => console.log(payload))
  .subscribe((status) => {
    if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
      // your callback function will now be called with the messages broadcast by the other client
    }
  })
```

:::info
`type` must be `broadcast` and the `event` must match for clients subscribed to the channel.
:::

### Roundtrip Latency

You can configure the channel so that the server must return acknowledgement that it received the `broadcast` message. This is useful if you want to measure roundtrip latency:

```js
// Supabase client setup

const channel = supabase.channel('calc-latency', {
  config: {
    broadcast: { ack: true }
  }
})

channel.subscribe(async (status) => {
    if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED) {
      const begin = performance.now()

      await channel.send({
        type: 'broadcast',
        event: 'latency',
        payload: {},
      })

      const end = performance.now()

      console.log(`Latency is ${end - begin} milliseconds`)
    }
  })
```

## Presence

Presence stores and synchronize shared state across clients.

The `sync` event is triggered whenever the shared state changes. The `join` event is triggered when new clients join the channel and `leave` event is triggered when clients leave.

Each client can use the channel's `track` method to store an object in shared state. Each client can only track one object, and if `track` is called again by the same client, then the new object will overwrite the previously tracked object in the shared state.

### Online Users

You can use one client to track and display users who are online:

```js
// Supabase client setup

const channel = supabase.channel('online-users', {
  config: {
    presence: {
      key: 'user1',
    },
  },
})

channel.on('presence', { event: 'sync' }, () => {
  console.log('Online users: ', channel.presenceState())
})

channel.on('presence', { event: 'join' }, ({ newPresences }) => {
  console.log('New users have joined: ', newPresences)
})

channel.on('presence', { event: 'leave' }, ({ leftPresences }) => {
  console.log('Users have left: ', newPresences)
})

channel.subscribe(async (status) => {
  if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    const status = await channel.track({ online_at: new Date().toISOString() })
    console.log(status)
  }
})
```

Then you can use another client to add another user to the channel's Presence state:

```js
// Supabase client setup

const channel = supabase.channel('online-users', {
  config: {
    presence: {
      key: 'user2',
    },
  },
})

// Presence event handlers setup

channel.subscribe(async (status) => {
  if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    const status = await channel.track({ online_at: new Date().toISOString() })
    console.log(status)
  }
})
```

:::info
If presence key is not given then server will generate a random UUID. `type` must be `presence` and `event` must be either `sync`, `join`, or `leave`.
:::

## Postgres CDC

Postgres Change Data Capture (CDC) enables your client to insert, update, or delete database records and have the changes sent to clients.

### Insert and Receive Persisted Messages

Start by creating a `messages` table to keep track of messages created by users in specific rooms:

```sql
create table messages (
  id serial primary key,
  message text,
  user_id text,
  room_id text,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
)

alter table messages enable row level security;

create policy "anon_ins_policy"
ON messages
for insert
to anon
with check (true);

create policy "anon_sel_policy"
ON messages
for select
to anon
using (true);
```

Make sure to create publication `supabase_realtime`, if it doesn't already exist, and add `messages` table to the publication:

```sql
begin;
  -- remove the supabase_realtime publication
  drop publication if exists supabase_realtime;

  -- re-create the supabase_realtime publication with no tables and only for insert
  create publication supabase_realtime with (publish = 'insert');
commit;

-- add a table to the publication
alter publication supabase_realtime add table messages;
```

You can then have a client listen for changes on the `messages` table for a specific room and send and receive persisted messages:

```js
// Supabase client setup

const channel = supabase.channel('db-messages')

const roomId = 'room1'
const userId = 'user1'

channel.on(
  'postgres-changes',
  {
    event: 'INSERT',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'messages',
    filter: `room_id=eq.${roomId}`,
  },
  (payload) => console.log(payload)
)

channel.subscribe(async (status) => {
  if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    const res = await supabase.from('messages').insert({
      room_id: roomId,
      user_id: userId,
      message: 'Welcome to Realtime!',
    })
    console.log(res)
  }
})
```
